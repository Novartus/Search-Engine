DAA Tutorial Our DAA Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. Our DAA Tutorial includes all topics of algorithm, asymptotic analysis, algorithm control structure, recurrence, master method, recursion tree method, simple sorting algorithm, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, divide and conquer, binary search, merge sort, counting sort, lower bound theory etc. What is Algorithm? A finite set of instruction that specifies a sequence of operation is to be carried out in order to solve a specific problem or class of problems is called an Algorithm. Why study Algorithm? As the speed of processor increases, performance is frequently said to be less central than other software quality characteristics (e.g. security, extensibility, reusability etc.). However, large problem sizes are commonplace in the area of computational science, which makes performance a very important factor. This is because longer computation time, to name a few mean slower results, less through research and higher cost of computation (if buying CPU Hours from an external party). The study of Algorithm, therefore, gives us a language to express performance as a function of problem size.
